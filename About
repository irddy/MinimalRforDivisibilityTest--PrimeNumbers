For any prime p (except for 2 and 5) there exists an integer r such that a similar divisibility test exists:

to check if a number is divisible by p, you need to split its decimal notation into r-tuples of digits

(starting from the right-end), add up these r-tuples and check whether their sum is divisible by p.

Given a prime int p, find the minimal r for which such divisibility test is valid and output it. 

The input consists of a single integer p - a prime between 3 and 999983, inclusive, not equal to 5. 

Example: 
Input: 3
Output: 1

Input: 11
Output: 2


PS: As of 9th of July 2020 this program is not yet finished. The output should be correct however, I am
currently working on a more advanced prototype that will give us more insight on prime numbers and their
unique traits.
